# About the App
This is a simple app written in Python and using Streamlit for playing rock, paper, scissors.

# File Organization
* Any depdendent modules/packages are found in `requirements.txt`. 
* `app.py` is the main executable for the app. If running locally, you can run it via the terminal with `streamlit run app.py`.
* `score.txt` serves as the data store for both the messaging (e.g., "You won") and the tallying of scores.
